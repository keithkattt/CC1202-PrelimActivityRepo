A repository for the Prelim Activity of CC1202-Intermediate Programming.

That has three different games, a splash screen and a main menu in the CLI that must be completed and created. 

The first program is a guessing game where the system would think a number, at random from 1 to 100, and the user would give their guesses until guess would pinpointed the number in search for. Count the number of guesses as basis of game points given. Guesses are limited to 10 tries only. The fewer the guess, the higher the points given. Create your own points system for the game.

The second program is a game for number tricks. The program would ask the user to think a number and the program would ask the user to follow instructions on whatever math operation is to be done be user.

After the above instruction is done add your additional operation (dynamic) which are randomly asked as the program progress. Give at least 5 dynamic additional operations through random generation. After which announce the result of the entire operation and watch them flip!


The third program is a racing game using random number generation that would use letters A, B, C, D, and E and the car identity in the race. The message instruction before the race tarts, and the ranking result after finishing the race, as who is the Champion, 1st runners up, and 2nd runners up.
